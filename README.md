# GasPumps-Model-Driven-Architecture

**Goal:**

The goal of this project is to design two different GasPump components using the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and then implement these GasPump components based on this design. This OO-oriented design based on the MDA-EFSM for both GasPump components.

The following OO design patterns have been implemented:

 **state pattern
 strategy pattern
 abstract factory pattern**
